<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">source</a><br>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a
    laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with
    a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of
    the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the
    keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a
    touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to
    run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<p>The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer), refers to the fact that the computer can be
    practically placed on the user&#39;s lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with
    paper notebooks. As of 2024, in American English, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably;[3] in
    other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.[4] The term notebook originally referred to a type of
    portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean the
    same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-laptops">Types of laptops</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Smaller and larger laptops</strong> There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller
        and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost
        &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like
        smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and
        heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.[44] All of these terms have
        fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except
        for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models,
        by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a &quot;gaming laptop&quot; or a &quot;mobile
        workstation&quot; for professional use.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1</strong> The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable
        computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate
        device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both
        tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet
        mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rugged laptop</strong> A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as
        strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and
        much more expensive than regular laptops,[47] and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were
    miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the
    maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has
    increasingly narrowed.[48]</p>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components
    that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable.</p>
